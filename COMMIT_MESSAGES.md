# Writing Commit Messages: DOs and DON'Ts

For this assignment, part of your grade is based on **Commit History & Workflow**. That means I am looking not only at the work in your README.md, but also at *how you got there* -- the series of commits you make as you build your project.

A commit is like saving your progress **with a note to yourself (and others)** about what changed. Good commit habits show steady progress and professionalism.  

## How Often Should You Commit?  
- Do not commit after every single sentence. That’s unnecessary.  
- Do not wait until the very end and commit everything at once. That defeats the purpose.  
- Instead, **commit when you’ve finished a meaningful chunk of work.**  
  - For example: finishing your `Introduction` section, adding an image, or revising the `Sustainability` section.  
- A good rule of thumb: aim for **10 to 20 commits** spread out across the time you’re working on the project.  

## What Makes a Good Commit Message?  
- Use the present tense, as if describing what this commit *does*.  
  - Example: `Add introduction section` (not “Added introduction section”)  
- Be specific about what changed, not just “stuff.”  
- Keep it short and clear. Usually one line is enough.  

## Examples of GOOD Commit Messages  
- `Add introduction about quantum computing`  
- `Insert image of blockchain diagram`  
- `Format sustainability section with headers and links`  
- `Revise postsecondary opportunities paragraph`  
- `Fix broken link in robotics section`  

These tell me exactly what you accomplished in that commit.  

## Examples of BAD Commit Messages  
- `Update`  
- `Work`  
- `Final version`  
- `Fixed stuff`  
- `asdf`  

These are too vague, unprofessional, or meaningless. They don’t tell me what you actually did.  

## Why This Matters  
- A clear commit history shows steady progress.  
- Professional commit messages are an expectation in real software development.  
- It helps you (and me) keep track of what was changed, when, and why.  

Treat your commit history like a **lab notebook**: a record of your thinking and your progress over time.
