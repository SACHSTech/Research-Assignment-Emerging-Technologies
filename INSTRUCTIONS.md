# ICS3U Unit 1 Research Assignment: Emerging Technologies

Choose one emerging technology from the list below (or propose your own with approval). Research it, then present your findings in a Markdown (`.md`) file in GitHub.

## Step 1: Choose a Topic
- Generative AI  
- Quantum Computing  
- Cybersecurity  
- Role of Computer Science in the Medical Field  
- Autonomous Vehicles  
- Augmented Reality  
- Virtual Reality  
- 5G  
- Sustainable Technology  
- Blockchain  
- Cryptocurrency  
- Edge Computing  
- Biotechnology in Agriculture  
- Green Energy Technologies  
- Wearable Health Monitors  
- Voice-Activated Technology  
- Robotics  
- Biocomputing  

**Note:** You may choose your own technology that is not on this list, but you must get approval from your teacher.

## Step 2: Research
As you research your topic, make sure you are able to answer the following questions:

### A. Understanding the Technology
- What is this technology, and how does it work?  
- Where is it currently being used, and how might it be used in the future?  

### B. Environmental Stewardship & Sustainability
- What resources (energy, materials, hardware) does this technology require?  
- What are the positive and negative impacts on the environment? On human health?  

### C. Postsecondary Opportunities
- What jobs or careers involve this technology?  
- What postsecondary programs could lead to working with this technology?  
- What skills are important in this field (technical and non-technical)?  

## Step 3: Present Your Technology
- Create your own GitHub Repository. Note that this done automatically when you "accepted" this assignment on GitHub Classroom.
- Write your research report in the [README.md](README.md) file of your repo.
- Use Markdown syntax to add formatting, contextual links, and images to your document.
- Your report must contain the following Markdown elements:
  - Headers
  - Paragraphs  
  - Line Breaks  
  - Emphasis (**bold**, *italic*)  
  - Blockquotes  
  - Images  
  - Links  

## Markdown Reference & Best Practices
- Read about [Markdown Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).
- **Headers:** Use different header levels (`##`, `###`, etc.) to create a hierarchy and organize your sections, like chapters and subheadings in a textbook.  
- **Inline Links:** Add contextual links directly in your text (e.g., linking to a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page)) so readers can explore more information.  
- **Images:** Use images to highlight key ideas and add visual impact. Images can be linked from the web, but uploading them to your repository is more reliable, since external links may break or disappear.  
- **Blockquotes:** Use blockquotes (`>`) to emphasize important definitions, quotes, or key ideas.
